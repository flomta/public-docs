access between different accounts. All [business entities](/models.md#business-entities) down the tree _belong_ to _one_ 
[Account](/models.md#Account). An [User](models.md#user) can be part of multiple Accounts via being an 
[AccountManager](/models.md#AccountManager). Account typically is the main business partner for Flomta OÃœ. Account will 
combine multiple [Companies](models.md#company) which are the main business partners for that Account.

[Account](/models.md#Aaccount)

apartment association managing one or multiple [Buildings](models.md#building). A company is the primary business unit
